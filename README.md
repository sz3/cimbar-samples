### cimbar-samples

Sample files for [cimbar-py](https://github.com/sz3/cimbar) and [libcimbar](https://github.com/sz3/libcimbar).

Used in tests!

This repository is an optional submodule in the above two repositories. It is also possible (and equally reasonable) to just download the current tag as a zip file and extract it as `samples/` -- where the submodule would go.
